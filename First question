Q1)Why are you applying for Financial Aid?
I am in my second year of B.E in college in India. I am currently unemployed and I am yet to be placed in my college.So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.I want to take this course as I want to learn.This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. I think it will be beneficial for me to get into a good firm. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid.Receiving this Financial Aid will open for me a new horizons of the world of Coursera courses , which in turn will help me in future .I am at a learning stage and it becomes a lot difficult for the family members to pay the whole amount for me and if I add up my course it will make even harder for them to pay. Sir, I need this course very badly for my development and for increasing my knowledge about the subject.
