Q3)If you answered no, please help us understand why?
The financial status of the family is not too good to pay the loan amount.It would make my parents life even harder to add a new loan over them. I don't want to put any pressure over them.It would be a great help for me to get a good job and knowledge for helping my family if I'm able to get this course.
